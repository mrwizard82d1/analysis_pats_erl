Analysis Patterns (Erlang)
==========================

In his book, _Analysis Patterns_, Martin Fowler describes a number of
*analysis* patterns. These patterns model many different domains.

To learn about different languages, I have chosen to implement (some
of) these models in different languages. This particular project
implements these patterns in Erlang.
